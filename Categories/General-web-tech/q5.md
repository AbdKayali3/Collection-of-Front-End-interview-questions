## What is Babel? What is it used for?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
- Source code transformations (codemods)
- And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)
