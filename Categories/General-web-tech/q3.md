## Difference between Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation






#### Graceful degradation:
Graceful degradation is the practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.

#### Progressive enhancement:
Progressive enhancement is the practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.

#### The difference:
It can be said that both progressive enhancement and graceful degradation try to do the same thing: keep our products useful to every user. Progressive enhancement is a more sophisticated and at the same time stable way of assuring that but it takes more time and effort. Graceful degradation can be used more easily as a patch for an already existing product; it means harder maintenance later on, but requires less initial work.
