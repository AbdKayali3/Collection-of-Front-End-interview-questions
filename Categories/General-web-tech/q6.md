## Difference between feature detection, feature inference and user-agent string parsing?

Feature detection is attempting to determine if a feature exists. For example, if the user's browser supports LocalStorage or the geolocation APIs.

Feature inference is assuming that because you've detected one feature that you can use other features. For example if you detect the geolocation API maybe you'd assume your user is on a modern browser and so now LocalStorage is available.

User agent string is just reading the stupid little string that each browser sends along and then you can compare that string with some known browsers you're targeting.
