## What are Web Components and what technologies do they use?
Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.

#### technologies
- Custom Elements: Global Custom Element is used for defining a custom element, extending an existing (native) one, and teaching the browser about a new tag.
- HTML Templates: HTML templates allow you to define HTML fragments that can be cloned or inserted into a document.
- Shadow DOM: Allows us to have an independent DOM with components and styles that do not affect others.
- ES Modules: The ECMAScript standard for importing JavaScript modules. It allows both synchronous and asynchronous loading of the modules, can analyze them statically, and therefore provides optimal loading of our dependencies.
