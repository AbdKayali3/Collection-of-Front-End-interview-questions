## What is the difference between adaptive and responsive designs?


#### Adaptive design:
In adaptive design, a different website layout is created for each device’s screen. As it loads, the site recognizes the size of the screen and serves up the layout that was made for that viewport.

#### Responsive design:
A website created with responsive design serves up the same site to every device, but that site is fluid and will change its layout and appearance based on the size and orientation of the device.

#### The difference:
- A responsive design can change its layout and appearance based on the screen size of the device it’s accessed on, from a large desktop computer to a small mobile phone.
- An adaptive design requires the creation of a different layout for each device the website will be accessed on.
- Responsive design often takes less work for a UX designer to create, but they will have to work with the developer to ensure the layout of the site is usable at each possible screen size.
- Adaptive design requires a UX designer to create up to six different versions of a single website for different-sized screens. While this is a lot of work, it enables the UX designer to optimize the user experience for every device these layouts cover.
- Responsive design often works best for bigger sites that are being designed from scratch.
- Adaptive design often works best for smaller sites that are being refreshed.
