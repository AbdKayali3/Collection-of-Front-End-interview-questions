## What is Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC)? How to avoid it?
Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.

#### Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC)
FOUC is an instance where a web page appears briefly with the browser's default styles prior to loading an external CSS stylesheet, due to the web browser engine rendering the page before all information is retrieved.The page corrects itself as soon as the style rules are loaded and applied; however, the shift may be distracting.

FOUC poses a very bad user experience, especially for new visitors who are not aware of this phenomenon. They might even think that your website poses a security threat. Plus the lag and abruptness of the transition decreases the legitimacy and professionalism of a website.


#### Avoding it
Firstly, make sure that most of the CSS are loading before the content if that possible (i.e. no styles in the body tag).
Another way is jsut to hide the content that is experincing this via JS and show it when the page fully loaded "onLoad event".
